In `Taymer-Computer-Vision-Challenge` an application for the measurement and CLassification of cables is developed. It is possible to load images via a graphical user interface. Using function buttons, the width of the cabel can be measured, an error can be detected and KLAssified, and the image can be saved with overly.
